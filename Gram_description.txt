We will be expecting to receive in a zip file:
• Source code
• Documentation (a small documentation about stuff we should be aware of – Unity version,
target platform etc. and your notes about the project, 3rd party frameworks you used).
- apk

Notes about the project:
While I hope this test project shows my ability to develop test projects,
it doesn't exactly have the architecture or consistent style I would expect in production.

For example, some values(like, how often a new hero is unlocked) are hardcoded.
In production values like these would be defined in config, but here, I hope, this is expected.

Real production and real teams require more complex structure, which evolves based on unique goals and constraints,
as well as needs of the team.
This is a simple project, so I've tried to keep it simple.
Trying to future-proof the test project by introducing complexity, so that an imaginary "real" project can benefit from it,
would take a lot of time, without any visible benefit to this test, imo.
I'd happy to chat about how more "real" version of this project might look like.

Also, in professional developer communnity, there is a popular idea,
that by separating big methods into smaller ones, you are always reducing complexity, even if it doesn't reduce lines of code,
or obscures linear order of many instructions.
I don't know what the position of Gram dev team on this,
but I don't agree with this idea and I don't do that here. Would be happy to discuss, if needed.

Project was developed in Unity 2020.3.17f1
Target platform - android.
Used 3rd party frameworks:
- Newtonsoft Json for serialization
- DOTween
